# the Privacy by Design framework

The [Privacy by Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/privacy-by-design-framework) framework is a useful tool for developing for user privacy.

The framework has seven principles:

1. Privacy must be proactive, not reactive, and must anticipate privacy issues before they reach the user. Privacy must also be preventative, not remedial.
2. Privacy must be the default setting. The user should not have to take actions to secure their privacy, and consent for data sharing should not be assumed.
3. Privacy must be embedded into design. It must be a core function of the product or service, not an add-on.
4. Privacy must be positive sum and should avoid dichotomies. For example, PbD sees an achievable balance between privacy and security, not a zero-sum game of privacy or security.
5. Privacy must offer end-to-end lifecycle protection of user data. This means engaging in proper data minimization,  retention and deletion processes.
6. Privacy standards must be visible, transparent, open, documented and independently verifiable. Your processes, in other words, must stand up to external scrutiny.
7. Privacy must be user-centric. This means giving users granular privacy options, maximized privacy defaults, detailed privacy information notices, user-friendly options and clear notification of changes.

Some of these principles are easily visible within the proposed open source guidelines, while others should be the focus of discussion.
